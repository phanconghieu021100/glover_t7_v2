1 : Gamelovers

2 : Select photos according to your preferences, mark like or dislike.

3 : "Gamelovers" is an innovative entertainment application, bringing a unique experience to users. With Gamelovers, you can choose according to your personal preferences from random themes such as houses, animals, architecture or nature. Each topic will display a series of related images or content. However, not all images have to be to your liking. If you're unhappy with a particular image, you can move it left to mark it as "disliked". On the contrary, if you see an image that is interesting and suits your interests, you can move it to the right to mark it as "like". Over time, the app will learn your preferences based on your choices. This helps improve your experience by displaying content tailored to your personal interests, creating a more personalized and enjoyable experience. The versatility of Gamelovers allows you to explore a variety of topics, expand your knowledge and explore the world around you. At the same time, the application also creates an interesting space for you to express and share your personal interests with the community.
